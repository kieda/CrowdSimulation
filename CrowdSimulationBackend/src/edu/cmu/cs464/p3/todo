[Todo List]

Internal Package : 
    
    3) EmotionLinearSystem: 
        find out initial multiprobabilisticsubspace for emotions
        find out how to modify the multiprobabilisticsubspace after we step in the LP
        
        (some linalg)
    3.5) find out threshold change for moodcolor, rest of multiprobabilityspace
        utility methods
    4) TokenModule (Max)
        find out how to translate the CCCIP to tokens.
        
        (some linalg)
    5) Probabilistic Subspace, MultiProbabilistic Subspace
        find out interaction
        find out a method to take the intersection of two
    6) find out PerceptionEmotionChange subclasses

TODO IMPORTANT : stabilize the internal game mechanics
make sure everything is working with respect to the game itself 
construct our objective and framework for making objectives.

Then (and only then) we can start testing the game and adding in components.


TODO 2 : add flag item into the game. Keep track of flag position.

--- 
later : memory module and estimate health module based on perception

Core/Game : 
    -- find out how we can determine everyone's field of view
        (octree???)

Internal Package : 
    
    3) EmotionLinearSystem: 
        find out initial multiprobabilisticsubspace for emotions
        find out how to modify the multiprobabilisticsubspace after we step in the LP
        
        (some linalg)

        utility methods
    4) TokenModule (max)
        find out how to translate the CCCIP to tokens.
        
        (some linalg)
    5) Probabilistic Subspace, MultiProbabilistic Subspace
        find out interaction
        find out a method to take the intersection of two
    6) find out PerceptionEmotionChange subclasses

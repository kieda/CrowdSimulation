[Todo List]

Housekeeping : 
    move all libraries into a dedicated .lib folder

Internal Package : 
    
    3) EmotionLinearSystem: 
        finish initial multiprobabilisticsubspace for emotions
        find out how to modify the multiprobabilisticsubspace after we step in the LP
        
        (some linalg)
    3.5) find out threshold change for moodcolor, rest of multiprobabilityspace
        utility methods
    4) TokenModule - improve translation function from CCCIP to tokens
    5) Probabilistic Subspace, MultiProbabilistic Subspace
        find out interaction
        find out a method to take the intersection of two
    6) find out PerceptionEmotionChange subclasses


--- 
later : memory module and estimate health module based on perception

Core/Game : 
    -- Use the quadtree to find out an agent's field of view
        a. determine a data structure for storing the field of view
        b. implement algorithm to determine GameObjects in the agent's sight.
